This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Todo App
This is a basic todo app built in React that enables the users to add, delete, edit and complete tasks.

# Dependencies
At this stage this project only uses the dependencies included on React-Create-App.

# User Journey
Initally the users have no tasks so they have to enter one on the input box.

## Adding new tasks
Enter your task on the input box and click on Add task.

## Complete task
Click on Complete to mark your task as done. The task will be scratched and greyed out and won't appear as pending.

## Edit task
Click on the Edit button to edit your taks. An overlay will show you the current text and you'll be able to edit it and accept the changes.

## Delete task
Click on Delete to delete your task.
